This dataset (UAV123_10fps) is a downsampled version of our short-term tracking dataset UAV123.
Annotations are located in the folder anno and named after the sequences names. 
The file configSeqs.m configures the dataset UAV123_10fps for OTB50/OTB100 and specifies all start and end frames.

The NaN annotations mean that the object is either fully occluded or outside the frame. 

If you are interested in our regular 30fps datasets from short-term (UAV123) and long-term tracking (UAV20L),
you can download them from our website. 

Please refer to our websites, paper and supplementary material for more details.
